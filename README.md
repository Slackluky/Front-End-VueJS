# vue-test

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn add node-sass(due to a problem installing node-sass with npm)

npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
then copy index.html to the /dist directory and link the <script> to ./build.js

run serve -s dist to serve locally
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
